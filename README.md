<h1 style ="bold">DAYS 4 & 5 of #100DaysOfCode</h1>

Today I made a mini app that displays the top stories from Hacker News using their <a href = "https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API.</a> <br> 
The articles pulled are stored in an SQLiteDatabase.

What I learned:
<ul>
<li>Practical application of SQLite Databases</li>
<li>API usage</li>
<li>Using WebViews</li>
</ul>
